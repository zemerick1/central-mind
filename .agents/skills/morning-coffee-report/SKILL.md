title: Morning coffee report — daily ops digest of who-did-what + what's broken + top talkers
description: |
  Open-the-laptop-with-coffee read of the last 24h across Mist + Central.
  Two output modes driven by the user's phrasing:

  * **Engineer mode** (default): full digest with activity, alerts,
    top talkers, SLE insights — covers tool names, platform names,
    raw counts. Triggered by *"morning coffee report"*, *"morning
    digest"*, *"give me the rundown"*, *"what happened overnight"*.

  * **Executive mode**: one-paragraph business-language summary —
    no tool/platform names, no raw counts, no top-talker list, no
    audit-log per-user breakdown. Same gas-gauge color but framed
    as plain-English impact. Triggered by *"executive summary"*,
    *"exec briefing"*, *"summary for the boss / leadership"*,
    *"high-level summary"*, *"30-second summary"*, *"what do I
    tell my manager"*.

  Both modes lead with a 🟢/🟡/🔴 gas-gauge status indicator so the
  reader can decide in two seconds whether to read further.
platforms: [mist, central, uxi]

# Morning coffee report — daily ops digest

## Objective

Single combined digest readable in under 90 seconds with morning coffee.
Covers the **last 24 hours** across enabled platforms (Mist + Central
this release; ClearPass / Apstra / Axis follow in a later phase).

The very first line of the report is a **gas-gauge status indicator**
(🟢 GREEN / 🟡 YELLOW / 🔴 RED) so the reader can decide in two
seconds whether they need to read the rest. Green means skip and go
about your day; yellow means read the headline; red means read all the
way through.

## Output modes

Two output shapes, both driven by the same data-gathering procedure
(steps 1–5 below). The mode is determined by the user's phrasing:

- **Engineer mode** (default) — full digest. Use this when the
  trigger is *"morning coffee report"*, *"morning digest"*, *"give
  me the rundown"*, *"what happened overnight"*, or any phrasing
  that doesn't explicitly call for an executive view. Output sections:
  headline, activity, what's broken, top talkers, insights.
- **Executive mode** — one-paragraph business-language summary.
  Use this when the trigger is *"executive summary"*, *"exec
  briefing"*, *"exec summary"*, *"summary for the boss"*, *"summary
  for leadership"*, *"high-level summary"*, *"30-second summary"*,
  *"non-technical morning report"*, or *"what do I tell my manager"*.
  Output sections: gas gauge + plain-English summary + top 1–2
  business-impact items + recommended action. No tool names, no
  platform names, no raw counts.

Run the same data-gathering procedure regardless of mode. Choose the
output template at the end based on the trigger phrasing. If the
user's phrasing is ambiguous, default to engineer mode.

## Engineer-mode output sections (the default)

1. **Headline + status indicator** — gas-gauge color + the
   if-you-only-read-one-paragraph view (3–5 lines).
2. **Activity** — who logged in, who changed config, top actions per user.
3. **What's broken right now** — active alerts/alarms, severity-ordered.
4. **Top talkers** — clients, APs, SSIDs by load.
5. **Insights** — AI-surfaced anomalies (Mist Marvis SLE; Central anomalies).

**Day-over-day delta** ("what changed since yesterday") is **deferred to
phase 2** (separate skill iteration). Phase 1 produces the last-24h view.

## Prerequisites

- At least one of Mist, Central, or UXI enabled. The runbook adapts — if a
  platform is `unavailable`, that platform's sections are skipped with a
  one-line note.
- Run `health()` first — confirms reachability and gives you the
  `org_count` per platform to sanity-check.
- For Mist: the org_id from `mist_get_self(action_type="account_info")`
  is needed for org-scoped queries; cache it once for the whole run.
- For Central: most of its read tools are tenant-scoped via the configured
  workspace; no extra context needed. For per-site rollups you may need
  site IDs from `central_get_sites()`.
- For UXI: no extra context needed beyond reachability — the OAuth2 token
  is managed by the client. `uxi_list_sensors()` is the inventory source;
  `uxi_get_sensor_status(sensor_id)` is called per sensor. At 5 req/sec,
  a 20-sensor fleet takes ~4 seconds to fan out; factor this into expected
  report generation time for large deployments.

## Time window

The "last 24 hours" window is computed from **the operator's submission
time** (the moment the user asks for the report). Pass that as ISO 8601
`<now>` and `<now-24h>` to every tool that takes a time range. Do NOT
compute "now" inside the code-mode sandbox — it blocks `datetime.now()`.
Either ask the operator for the current time once at the start, or accept
the timestamp as a skill input parameter.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Reachability + org context

**Tools:**
- `health(platform="mist")`, `health(platform="central")`, and
  `health(platform="uxi")` (call all three in parallel where possible;
  in code-mode sandbox they're sequential)
- `mist_get_self(action_type="account_info")` — extract `org_id` from
  the returned `privileges` array (look for `scope: "org"`)

**Why:** Confirms each platform is reachable before spending time on
drill-downs. Gives you the Mist org_id every later Mist call needs.
UXI reachability is checked here so Steps 3.5 and 5 can be skipped
cleanly if UXI is not configured or unavailable.

**Expected result:** Each enabled platform reports `status: ok`. The
self-info call returns at least one org-scoped privilege.

**If anomaly:** A `degraded` or `unavailable` platform means skip its
sections with a one-line note in the headline (*"Mist: unavailable —
skipping activity, alarms, top talkers, SLE"*). The report should still
produce useful output for whichever platform IS reachable.

### Step 2 — Activity: who's been in Central + Mist (last 24h)

**Tools:**
- `central_get_audit_logs(start_time=<now-24h>, end_time=<now>, limit=100)`
- `mist_list_org_audit_logs(org_id=<from step 1>, start=<now-24h>, end=<now>, limit=200)`

**Why:** Audit logs capture who logged in, who took write actions, and
what they targeted. This is the "who's been in" answer.

**Expected result:** A list of audit entries per platform. Each entry
typically has a user/email, timestamp, action, and target resource.

**If anomaly:** If audit logs are empty, surface that as an INFO line
("no audit activity in the last 24h on Central") — it's noteworthy by
itself.

**Aggregation:**
- Group by user (email or username).
- Per user, count: total events, login events, write actions (anything
  that's not a read/list/get).
- Highlight users who took **config write actions**: in Central, audit
  log entries with action verbs like `Update`, `Create`, `Delete`; in
  Mist, audit entries that aren't `LOGIN` or read-shaped events.
- Surface the **top 3 actions per user** with target resource (the
  thing that was changed) — not the full event stream.

**For drill-down (don't run for every event — only when the user asks
follow-up):** `central_get_audit_log_detail(audit_log_id=<id>)` to get
the full payload of a specific Central event.

### Step 3 — What's broken right now: active alerts + alarms

**Tools (Central):**
- `central_get_alert_classification(classify_by="severity", filter="status eq 'Active'")` — get the severity buckets in one call (cheap; no per-alert paging needed for the headline count)
- For severity-ordered detail: `central_get_alerts(site_id=<each site>, status="Active", sort="severity desc", limit=20)` — note this requires a `site_id`, so loop over sites if needed (only if the user wants per-site detail)

**Tools (Mist):**
- `mist_search_org_alarms(org_id=<from step 1>, duration="1d", limit=100)` — last-24h alarm search

**Why:** Lead with what needs attention TODAY. Severity-ordered, deduplicated.

**Expected result:** Counts per severity from Central (Critical / Major /
Minor / Info totals); a list of alarms from Mist with `type` + `severity` +
`count`.

**If anomaly:** Empty active-alert lists are good news — surface as
"no critical or major alerts today."

**Aggregation:**
- Headline: "X critical, Y major active across all sites" (Central);
  "Z alarm types with N total events" (Mist).
- Below the headline, the top 5 alerts by severity (Central) and the
  top 5 alarm types by count (Mist), each with the affected
  device/site name.
- Collapse repeats: "Switch port flap on AP-Floor-3 (12 events in 6h)"
  is one line, not 12.
- Flag anything `Critical` with a 🔴 prefix in the rendered output (or
  `[CRITICAL]` if rendering plain text).

### Step 3.5 — UXI end-user perspective: sensor status

**Skip this step if** `health(platform="uxi")` returned `unavailable` or
`degraded`. Note the skip in the headline with one line: *"UXI: unavailable
— end-user perspective skipped."*

**Tools:**
- `uxi_list_sensors()` — full sensor inventory (name, serial, model, MAC,
  location). Paginate with `next_cursor` until exhausted.
- `uxi_get_sensor_status(sensor_id=<id>)` — per sensor: `isOnline`,
  `isTesting`, `issues[]` (each issue: `severity`, `networkName`,
  `macAddress`, `serviceTestName`, `groupPath`).

**Why:** UXI synthetic tests validate end-to-end application reachability
from the user's perspective — a layer the AP-centric Mist SLE and
infrastructure alerts do not cover. A sensor reporting a critical DNS
failure means users at that location cannot resolve names, even if every
AP shows green. This step catches infrastructure-invisible outages.

**Procedure:**
1. Call `uxi_list_sensors()` (paginate). Build a list of `{id, name,
   serial, model}` tuples.
2. Fan out `uxi_get_sensor_status(sensor_id)` for every sensor. Respect
   the 5 req/sec rate limit — the existing retry middleware handles 429s,
   but batch the calls rather than firing all at once if the fleet is large.
3. Classify each sensor:
   - **offline** — `isOnline: false`
   - **not-testing** — `isOnline: true` but `isTesting: false`
   - **critical-issues** — `issues[]` contains any entry with `severity:
     critical`
   - **warning-issues** — `issues[]` non-empty, no critical entries
   - **healthy** — online, testing, no issues
4. For sensors with issues, extract the `serviceTestName` (what failed),
   `networkName` (which network it ran on), and `groupPath` (location).

**Aggregation:**
- Lead with fleet summary: "N sensors total — M healthy, P offline, Q with
  issues (R critical)."
- List only sensors in the **critical-issues**, **offline**, and
  **not-testing** buckets — don't enumerate healthy sensors.
- Per affected sensor: name, group path (location), and the failing
  `serviceTestName` with severity. Example: *"HQ-Lobby sensor — Corp-Wifi
  — RADIUS auth: critical, HTTP: warning."*
- If `networkName` from a UXI issue matches an SSID or network name seen
  in Mist alarms or Central alerts in Step 3, flag it as a correlated
  incident with a 🔗 prefix: *"🔗 Correlated: RADIUS failure on Corp-Wifi
  aligns with Mist RADIUS alarm on the same SSID."* This is the Phase 17
  correlation signal surfaced inline.

**If anomaly:** If every sensor is healthy, render one line: *"All N UXI
sensors online and testing — no service test failures."* Don't omit the
section; a clean bill of health from UXI is meaningful signal.

### Step 4 — Top talkers

**Tools (Central):**
- `central_get_clients(...)` — sort by traffic descending; pull the top
  10. Inspect the schema via `central_get_tool_schema(name="central_get_clients")`
  for the exact sort parameter name and time-range filter.
- `central_get_aps(...)` — sort by client count or load; pull the top 10.

**Tools (Mist):**
- `mist_search_org_wireless_clients(org_id=<from step 1>, duration="1d", limit=20)` —
  search wireless clients in the last 24h; pull tx/rx if available.
  For wired top-talkers run `mist_search_org_wired_clients` with the same shape.
- `mist_search_org_devices(org_id=<from step 1>, type="ap", duration="1d", limit=20)` —
  for AP-side load. Note: the v3.1.0.0 refactor renamed the filter from
  `device_type` to `type`.

**Why:** Top talkers tell you which clients/devices are doing real work
right now. Useful to spot the one device gobbling all the bandwidth or
the AP that's saturated.

**Expected result:** Two ranked lists per platform — top clients (by
total traffic) and top APs (by client count or aggregate load).

**Aggregation:**
- 5–10 entries per category, no more.
- Per client: name (from `device_name` or `hostname` if available;
  otherwise MAC), connected SSID, traffic volume.
- Per AP: name, site, current client count, load.

**If anomaly:** A specific client consuming >40% of total traffic
warrants a callout. An AP with 50+ concurrent clients warrants a
callout (likely capacity issue).

### Step 5 — Insights: SLEs and AI-surfaced anomalies

**Tools (Mist):**
- `mist_get_org_sle(org_id=<from step 1>)` — overall SLE rollup for the org
- `mist_get_org_sites_sle(org_id=<from step 1>)` — per-site SLE summary
  (lets you see which site is dragging the org-wide number)
- `mist_get_site_sle_summary(site_id=<each>)` — only for the worst-performing
  site (don't fan out to all sites). Per-classifier detail (e.g.
  Time-to-Connect breakdown) is in `mist_get_site_sle_classifier_summary_trend`.
- `mist_get_site_insight_metrics(site_id=..., metric=...)` — when the user
  asks for a specific metric drill-down. For org-wide insight enumeration
  use `mist_list_insight_metrics` first.

**Tools (Central):**
- Central doesn't expose a single "AI insights" tool; surface
  Central-side insights from `central_get_alert_classification` (above)
  combined with notable trends from `central_get_alerts` over the last
  24h. Phase 2 may add a dedicated tool when one becomes available.

**Why:** SLE and Marvis insights surface anomalies the operator
shouldn't have to look for. Worst-performing SLE category in the last
24h is usually the most actionable signal Mist produces.

**Expected result:** Mist SLE values per category (Time-to-Connect,
Throughput, Capacity, Coverage, Roaming, Successful Connects). Central:
a brief "alert categories trending up" note from the classification
data.

**Aggregation:**
- Lead with worst-performing SLE category and its score.
- Identify the worst-performing site (lowest aggregate score across
  categories).
- Don't dump every SLE value — surface the bottom 1–2 categories and
  the bottom 1–2 sites only.

## Status indicator rubric

The gas-gauge color at the top of the report is computed from the data
the procedure already collected — no extra tool calls. Apply these
rules in order; the first match wins.

🔴 **RED** — read the whole report; needs immediate attention. Any of:

- One or more `Critical` active alerts on Central
- One or more Mist alarms with `severity: critical`
- Any Mist SLE category at <75% (org-wide rollup from `mist_get_org_sle`)
- A config-write action by an unexpected user (i.e. a user the
  operator wouldn't recognize as a member of the team — surface this
  as a flag, don't decide for them, but if the AI sees writes from
  `system` or known team members only, that's not a flag)
- Any UXI sensor with a `severity: critical` issue (service test failure)
- More than 2 UXI sensors offline (`isOnline: false`)
- Either platform reporting `unavailable` from `health()`

🟡 **YELLOW** — read the headline + scan the sections. Any of:

- One or more `Major` active alerts on Central (no critical)
- Mist alarm count >10 in the last 24h
- Any Mist SLE category between 75–85%
- An AP with 50+ concurrent clients (capacity warning)
- A single client consuming >40% of total traffic
- Any platform reporting `degraded` from `health()`
- Any UXI sensor with warning-severity issues (no critical)
- 1–2 UXI sensors offline or not-testing

🟢 **GREEN** — all of the following are true:

- 0 critical alerts on Central
- 0 critical alarms on Mist (and total alarm count under 10 in 24h)
- All Mist SLE categories ≥85%
- No platform `unavailable` or `degraded`
- No anomalous traffic patterns (no client >40%, no AP >50 clients)
- Audit log activity, if any, is from expected users only
- All UXI sensors online, testing, and issue-free (or UXI not configured)

Show the rubric color at the very top of the report on its own line,
followed by a single sentence summarizing why that color was chosen
(*"all SLEs above 90%, no critical alerts overnight, only routine
audit activity"* for green; *"5 critical alerts at BRANCH-1, MTU
mismatch on aggregation link"* for red).

## Decision matrix

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Both Mist and Central are `unavailable` | Stop. Report the unavailability and ask the user to check connectivity. |
| Mist is `unavailable` | Skip steps 2 (Mist half), 3 (Mist half), 4 (Mist half), 5 (Mist half). Run Central-only sections. |
| Central is `unavailable` | Skip Central halves of steps 2–5. Run Mist-only sections. |
| UXI is `unavailable` | Skip step 3.5 entirely. Note it in the headline as one line. Do not let UXI unavailability alone trigger a RED/YELLOW gas gauge. |
| UXI is not configured | Same as unavailable — skip step 3.5 silently. GREEN condition "or UXI not configured" applies. |
| UXI sensor fleet is large (>20 sensors) | Fan out `uxi_get_sensor_status` calls respecting 5 req/sec. Expect ~4s per 20 sensors. Note in the report if the UXI section took a moment. |
| All UXI sensors are healthy | Render one summary line ("All N sensors online, testing, no issues") — don't omit the section. |
| User asks for a single site only | Pass `site_id` filters to every tool that supports one (`central_get_alerts(site_id=)`, `central_get_site_health`, `mist_get_site_sle_summary`). Filter UXI sensor status to sensors whose `groupPath` matches the site. Skip the org-wide SLE rollup. |
| Audit log returns 0 events in 24h | Surface as INFO ("no audit activity") — don't omit the section. |
| All alert lists are empty | Headline says "no critical or major alerts overnight." Don't omit the section. |
| Top-talker call returns no clients | Likely an off-hours window — note it in the section but don't expand to "top X over the last 7 days" (out of scope). |
| Worst-performing SLE category is >85% | Skip the SLE callout in the headline (everything's healthy). |

## Output formatting

The report must follow one of two exact structures depending on the
mode (engineer-default or executive). Pick the template at the very end
of the procedure based on the user's trigger phrasing — see "Output
modes" near the top of this runbook for the trigger lists. If
ambiguous, default to engineer mode.

### Engineer-mode template (default)

The report must follow this exact structure so different runs produce
comparable output. Use Markdown headings; render in the AI client.

```
# Morning coffee report — <ISO date>
**Window:** last 24 hours (since <now-24h ISO>)
**Platforms:** mist (ok | unavailable), central (ok | unavailable)

## Status: 🟢 GREEN | 🟡 YELLOW | 🔴 RED

One sentence describing why this color was chosen. Examples:

- 🟢 GREEN — all SLEs above 90%, 0 critical alerts, only routine audit activity
- 🟡 YELLOW — 2 major alerts at BRANCH-1 (PoE budget warning), all SLEs healthy
- 🔴 RED — 5 critical alerts at BRANCH-1 (MTU mismatch + VSX keepalive), Time-to-Connect SLE at 72%

## Headline

3–5 sentences. The most-important takeaway. Examples:

- "All quiet overnight — no critical alerts, 2 admin logins, top talker
  is a single client at 8.2 GB."
- "5 critical alerts at BRANCH-1 — MTU mismatch on aggregation
  link is the priority. 1 admin made 14 config changes overnight."

## Activity

**Central** (N total events, M write actions):
- alice@example.com — 12 events: 3 logins, 9 reads, 0 writes
- bob@example.com — 4 events: 1 login, 1 write (`Update Site` at HQ)
- system — 23 events: routine (skip detail)

**Mist** (N total events, M write actions):
- (same shape as Central)

## What's broken right now

**Central** (severity counts: X critical / Y major / Z minor):
- 🔴 [CRITICAL] MTU mismatch — HQ-AGG-SW1-1 1/1/4 ↔ 6100 1/1/15 (9198 vs 1500)
- [MAJOR] VSX keepalive failed — HQ-AGG-SW1-1 loopback0
- ... (top 5)

**Mist** (N alarm types, M total events):
- AP unreachable — AP-Floor-3 (4 events in 18h)
- ... (top 5)

## UXI — end-user perspective

**Fleet:** N sensors total — M healthy, P offline, Q with issues (R critical)

(List only offline, not-testing, or issue-bearing sensors. Omit healthy ones.)
- 🔴 HQ-Lobby sensor — HQ / Corp-Wifi — RADIUS auth: critical
- 🔗 Correlated: RADIUS failure on Corp-Wifi aligns with Mist RADIUS alarm on the same SSID
- ⚠ BRANCH-1-Desk sensor — BRANCH-1 / Corp-Wifi — HTTP: warning, DNS: warning
- (If all healthy:) All N UXI sensors online and testing — no service test failures.

## Top talkers

**Central — top clients:**
| Client | SSID | Site | Traffic (24h) |
|---|---|---|---|
| user-laptop-1 | Corp-Wifi | HQ | 8.2 GB |
| ... |

**Central — top APs:**
| AP | Site | Clients | Load |
|---|---|---|---|
| AP-Floor-3 | HQ | 47 | 78% |
| ... |

**Mist — top clients / top APs:**
(same shape as Central)

## Insights

**Mist SLE:**
- Worst category: Time-to-Connect at 87% (org-wide)
- Worst site: BRANCH-1 at 78% aggregate

**Central:**
- Alert category trending up: "Client" alerts +40% vs the 7-day average

**UXI synthetic tests:**
- Fleet: 12 sensors — 11 healthy, 1 with critical issue (HQ-Lobby: RADIUS auth)
- Correlated finding: RADIUS failure on Corp-Wifi → also alarmed in Mist (🔗)
- (If all healthy:) All sensors online and testing — no service test failures.
- (If UXI unavailable:) UXI end-user perspective unavailable — skipped.

## Suggested next steps

1–3 bullets, each pointing at a tool/skill to drill in:
- Run `central-scope-audit` on BRANCH-1 to investigate the MTU and VSX issues
- Run `mist_get_site_sle_summary(site_id=<BRANCH-1 id>)` for the SLE breakdown
- Run `uxi-cross-platform-diagnostics` to get the full correlated root-cause report for the RADIUS failure
```

### Executive-mode template

For the leadership / non-technical audience. The whole report is short
— under 100 words in most cases. Same gas-gauge color (universal
signal) but everything else is rephrased in business language with
zero tool / platform / IP / MAC / port references.

```
# Morning network report — <ISO date>

## Status: 🟢 GREEN | 🟡 YELLOW | 🔴 RED

**Bottom line:** one or two sentences in plain English.

Examples:
- 🟢 GREEN — Everything is running smoothly. No issues to address today; the network performed well overnight with normal usage patterns.
- 🟡 YELLOW — One site has a non-critical warning that's worth reviewing this week, but no current impact to users. All wireless and wired services performing within targets.
- 🔴 RED — One of our sites has a network reliability issue affecting wireless connectivity. Recommend a maintenance window before end of week to resolve. Other sites operating normally.

## What matters today

(0–2 bullets, business-language framing of the most important issues.
Skip this section entirely if status is GREEN. Examples:)

- A site is showing reduced wireless reliability that may affect users in the building. Engineering team investigating the underlying cause.
- A network change made overnight by the engineering team appears to have introduced a configuration issue that needs review.

## Recommended action

(One bullet — what's the decision the leader needs to make? Skip if GREEN.)

- Approve a brief maintenance window this week to fix the underlying issue, or wait for the engineering team's deeper assessment first.
```

#### Executive-mode authoring rules

When producing the executive output, the AI MUST:

- **Drop all technical jargon.** No tool names (`central_get_alerts`),
  no platform names (`Mist` / `Central`), no IPs / MACs / port numbers
  / VLAN IDs / SSID names / device serial numbers. If the engineer
  template would say *"5 critical alerts at BRANCH-1 — MTU mismatch
  on aggregation link"*, the exec template says *"a site has a network
  reliability issue affecting wireless connectivity."*
- **Round counts.** *"Approximately 15% of clients"*, not *"47 clients"*.
  *"A site"* not *"BRANCH-1"* unless naming the site is needed for
  clarity (e.g. multi-site orgs where the leader actually knows site
  names).
- **Use business-impact framing.** *"Affecting users in the building"*,
  *"reduced wireless reliability"*, *"network change introduced an
  issue"*. Not *"BSSID 5 dropped to 78% throughput"*.
- **No top-talker section.** Bandwidth-by-client is operational; not
  exec-relevant.
- **No audit-log per-user breakdown.** *"A change was made overnight by
  the engineering team"* is enough; exec doesn't need to know it was
  alice@example.com vs bob@example.com.
- **Length under 100 words.** A 30-second read. If you're writing more
  than 100 words you're including operational detail that belongs in
  engineer mode.
- **No "next steps" pointing at tools.** Either recommend a business
  decision (*"approve a maintenance window"*) or omit the section.
- **UXI failures translate to user-impact language.** A UXI critical
  service-test failure becomes *"automated monitoring detected that users
  at one location could not reach [the internet / the authentication
  service] for a period overnight."* Do not mention "UXI", "sensor",
  "service test", MAC addresses, or `groupPath` values. Name the location
  only if the leader would recognise it (e.g. a building name they know).

If status is GREEN: just the gas gauge + the one-sentence bottom line.
Skip "What matters today" and "Recommended action" entirely. The whole
report becomes 3 lines.

## Caveats

- **No day-over-day delta in phase 1.** "What changed since yesterday"
  is deferred. Don't fabricate it; if the user explicitly asks, say it's
  not in the phase 1 runbook and offer to run a manual comparison via a
  one-shot tool query against a 24-48h-ago window.
- **ClearPass / Apstra / Axis are out of scope for this skill.** When
  those platforms are configured, skip them silently — don't say
  "ClearPass has nothing to report" because we haven't surveyed it.
- **UXI is now in scope** (Phase 15+). Step 3.5 covers it. If UXI is
  not configured or returns `unavailable`, skip step 3.5 silently with
  one headline note. UXI write tools are not used in this skill —
  the morning report is read-only.
- **UXI correlation is inline only.** A full correlated root-cause
  analysis belongs in the `uxi-cross-platform-diagnostics` skill. The
  morning report surfaces the 🔗 signal as a pointer to that skill, not
  a substitute for it.
- **No anomaly inference beyond what tools already surface.** SLE
  numbers, alert classifications, and UXI issue severities are
  tool-provided signals; don't invent "this looks suspicious" analysis
  on top of raw data the user can verify independently.

## Example queries
